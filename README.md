ðŸ‘‹  Hi, my name is San Jung. 

<br>

I started my career as a tax accountant in the personal wealth sector handling tax matters for high net worth individuals and then I transferred internally to the Business Transformation team and worked on projects to automate certain processes for the tax department. In my most recent job, I worked as a cybersecurity consultant and worked on projects such as creating cyber incident response plans and implementing procedures for identity & access management. 


While these roles have taught me valuable skills such as analytical thinking, problem-solving, and the ability to work in teams, I wanted to pursue a role that would channel more of my creative side.
Wanting to create something from scratch and seeing it come to fruition, I strongly believe that Software Development is the next step in my career as it has an unique combination of structure and logic along with creativity and innovation.  


I am really looking forward to becoming a fullstack software developer where I can utilize some of the skills I've picked up from my previous jobs and to contribute to software projects that can have an impact on consumers and different users.

âœ¨ In my Private Repositories, I have 2 Tech Elevator capstone projects to showcase my work. I would love to share them with you! âœ¨</br>
* Vending Maching Application: Object-Oriented Programming Principles, Java, and file I/O  </br>
* Payment Service Application: Spring Boot RESTful API, PostgreSQL database, and Postman </br>
